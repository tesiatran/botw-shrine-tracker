# Shrine Tracker

[Live Site](http://shrines.tesiatran.com/)

## Project Details

Shrine Tracker is a place for you to track the completion status of each shrine in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You can keep track of what type of shrine it is (dropdown), the location of it (input), whether you've completed it/acquired the spirit orb (boolean), and how many chests you found (number). You'll be able to add, delete, and modify as necessary. Happy adventuring!
